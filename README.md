## User Stories

* User is presented with the menu screen and given the option to click "start game", "how to play", and "credits" buttons.
* If user clicks "start game" they are taken to the game screen where they can play throught the level.
* If user clicks "how to play" they are taken to a screen that tells them the controls of the game.
* If user clicks "credits" they see who made the game along with links to social media.
* In the game screen, our user has 60 seconds to make it to their pair square without hitting the walls. Their score counts down from 360 by 2 points/second.
* If they hit the walls or runs out of time, they lose a life and start back at the beginning.
* If the user runs through all three lives, they are presented with a lose screen. On this screen they are given the option to reset, go to the main menu, or view the credits page.
* Clicking reset allows the user to reset all their stats.
* If the user reaches their pair square they they are presented with the win screen which displays their score and gives them the option to reset the game or view the credits. They can also moves around on the screen as much as they want after winning.
