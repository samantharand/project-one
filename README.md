* If they hit the walls or runs out of time, they lose a life and start back at the beginning.
* If the user runs through all three lives, they are presented with a lose screen. On this screen they are given the option to reset, go to the main menu, or view the credits page.
* Clicking reset allows the user to reset all their stats.
